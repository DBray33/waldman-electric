## Technical Details

### HTML Structure

The site uses a modern HTML5 structure with semantic elements to improve accessibility and SEO. All pages follow a consistent template with shared header and footer sections.

### CSS Organization

- `styles.css` - Main stylesheet containing global styles
- `navbar.css` - Dedicated styles for the navigation components

### JavaScript Architecture

The JavaScript (`script.js`) follows a modular design pattern with separate concerns:

- **App** - Main namespace and initialization controller
- **MobileNavigation** - Handles mobile menu behavior
- **MediaElements** - Controls video and audio elements
- **HeaderBehavior** - Manages header appearance during scroll
- **BusinessHours** - Updates opening hours in real-time
- **ScrollBehavior** - Handles scroll-based animations and effects
- **ParallaxEffect** - Creates parallax scrolling effect on the hero section
- **ServicesAnimation** - Handles animations for service cards
- **TestimonialAnimations** - Controls testimonial section animations
- **ReasonCardAnimations** - Manages animations for "Why Choose Us" cards
- **BackToTopButton** - Implements back-to-top functionality

The codebase uses the IntersectionObserver API for scroll-based animations, providing better performance than scroll event listeners.
