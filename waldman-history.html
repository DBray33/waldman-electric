                  Waldman Electrical Contractors traces its roots to the Stitzer
                  & Waldman Electric Company, which began operations in 1918 at
                  438 Penn Avenue, West Reading. At that time there were four
                  Waldmans involved. Edward Waldman and Charles Stitzer were
                  partners and they hired Edward's three brothers, George,
                  William and Leon. This firm represented one of the few
                  electrical companies in Berks County and was instrumental in
                  helping convert the area from gas to electricity.

                  Electric lighting was the main domestic load during the early
                  part of the century; therefore, a 30 ampere service was
                  sufficient. It was a time when service personnel, carrying
                  their tools and pipe, rode the trolley to the jobs. Pipe was
                  often bent using the crook of a nearby tree or a convenient
                  sewer pipe.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Along with the advent of electric appliances, Stitzer and
                  Waldman grew, and in 1929 bought the property and constructed
                  the building, which housed the company at 514 Penn Avenue.

                  The company survived the Depression and kept busy with both
                  private and commercial accounts. Commercial customers included
                  Whitner's, where two electricians were permanently assigned
                  on-site, Tulpehocken Dairy, Colonial Theater, St. Margaret's

                <p>
                  During the thirties and forties, the company did most of the
                  wiring in Wyomissing and West Reading, most notably the
                  private estates. The company also maintained an extensive

                  Charles Stitzer died in the late forties and Edward Waldman
                  retired soon after. In 1950, Leon, George and William Waldman
                  became partners in Waldman's Electric. The company's first
                  contract was the West Reading School.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The three brothers were joined by Leon's son, Leon Jr. (Red),
                  Luther Piersol and by George's two sons. In 1952 Kitty Cranage
                  came to Waldman's. For the next 25 years, this was the nucleus
                  of the firm. During this period the complexion of the company
                  changed with the phasing out of appliance sales and an
                  increased emphasis on the contracting operations.

                  In 1975, Waldman's Electric reorganized as Waldman Electric
                  Company, Inc., with Leon and Red as the sole owners and
                  operators. Peter Waldman, Red's son, joined the company at

                  Following Red's death in 1980, Pete became chief operating
                  officer. Leon Waldman died in 1985 and the following year the
                  retail store was closed to further expand the contracting
                  business.

                  With the closing of the store, Kitty retired and the office
                  was moved to Leon's home in Exeter Township. At that time
                  David Waldman, Red's younger son, joined the corporation and
                  assumed some of the responsibilities of conducting the
                  business.
